"""The REST face of command-svc: POST /command plus the standard health
endpoints, one app.

The request body is contracts.JointCommand and the response is
contracts.CommandReceipt — this layer adds transport concerns (IDs, status
codes), never payload shapes. Malformed commands (unknown kind, move_joints
without positions) are rejected by the contract itself: FastAPI surfaces
Pydantic validation as 422 before any handler runs.

This service is already an HTTP app, so health lives here rather than in a
separate health.py; the endpoints match the other services exactly (ADR-0004).
