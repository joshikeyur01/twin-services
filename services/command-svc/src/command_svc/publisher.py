"""The MQTT half of command-svc.

Holds one long-lived broker connection; the API layer hands validated
commands to publish(). When the broker is down, publish() raises instead of
buffering — an accepted command that silently goes nowhere would be a lie,
so the REST layer turns this into a 503 (each service documents its
degradation policy; ADR-0004).

Commands go out QoS 1 (at-least-once): losing a 50 Hz telemetry sample is
noise, losing a setpoint is a missing robot motion. The bridge deduplicates
by command semantics (a setpoint is idempotent), so at-least-once is safe.
